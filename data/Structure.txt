Here are structured gameplay ideas that fit a school-life psychological narrative game powered by the kitsune masks, using time-management, choices, and dual-life tension (daytime school → nighttime spirit world).

I’ll give you:

Daily gameplay loop

Daytime mechanics (school life)

Nighttime mechanics (masks, spirits, corruption)

Systems that make choices matter

Event ideas & consequences

🌀 1. Daily Gameplay Loop (Core Structure)
Morning

Choose a mask to bring (only 1–2 masks per day to limit power abuse)

Check your “inner state” (corruption %, mask relationship changes)

School Day (Main gameplay)

Every action takes time blocks (e.g., 15–60 minutes)

Player chooses what to do in free periods or secretly in class

Masks influence:

dialogue options

ability boosts

risk levels

moral alignment

After School

More open-ended time for:

clubs

social interactions

errands

following rumors

Evening Home Recap

Mask spirits comment on the day

Player sees subtle consequences (text messages, rumors spreading, trust shifting)

Stats update:

Mask corruption

Social bonds

Mental stability

Reputation

Night

Option A: Sleep (safer, stable)

Option B: Sneak out wearing a mask (dangerous, rewarding)

Visit shrine

Explore nighttime locations

Do “spirit tasks” requested by masks

Encounter illusions or memory fragments

Each day feels like a push-pull:

Use masks to solve your problems → masks get stronger

Resist them → school life gets harder

🎒 2. Daytime Mechanics (School Life)

Here’s where the psychology shines.

📚 Classroom Choices

Actions (each taking time):

Pay attention

Doze off

Cheat on the test

Whisper with classmates

Use a mask ability secretly (risky)

Examples with masks:

Ambition Mask: highlight answers on a test

Trickster Mask: create an illusion to distract teacher

Loyalty Mask: help a friend but your own grade suffers

Fear Mask: sense who is watching you cheat

💬 Social Simulation

Gossip system

Relationship tracking

Rumors influence how teachers & students treat you

Masks heavily affect social conversations

Examples:

Joy Mask: boosts charm → you become popular faster

Rage Mask: intimidate bullies → but gain a “violent reputation”

Grief Mask: empathize deeply → people confide dark secrets

🏃 Hallways / Between Classes

Limited time segments:

Check club room

Talk to a crush

Help a friend

Track down someone suspicious (using Fear Mask)

Escape a teacher looking for you

🏆 School Reputation System

Three axes:

Academics

Social standing

Morality

Masks shift you naturally, building long-term consequences.

🌙 3. Nighttime Mechanics (Mystical Gameplay)
🦊 Night Exploration

Use masks freely at night → abilities stronger, consequences harsher

Shrine (mask spirits live here)

Abandoned streets

Rooftop access

Forest path → illusions & fragmented memories

🔮 Spirit Contracts

Masks give missions:

Trick someone

Steal a memory

Protect a student

Observe someone secretly

Completing missions:

Boosts mask relationship
− Raises corruption
± Alters next day’s events (a student shows up exhausted, missing, crying, terrified, overly friendly, etc.)

🕳 Corruption Events (Nightmares)

If corruption is too high:

Nightmares become gameplay segments

Player sees distorted versions of classmates

Must escape their own subconscious

🌒 Mask Whispers

At night masks talk to you.
Some argue with each other.
Some demand obedience.
Some try to warn you.

You are never fully alone.

🔧 4. Systems That Make Choices Matter
✔ Time Pressure

You never have enough time for everything.
Your mask choice each morning changes the priorities.

✔ Mask Corruption & Personality Merge

Each mask has its own “influence meter.”
Using a mask often:

changes your dialogue

shifts your morality

changes visual UI cues

distorts your worldview

If a mask hits 100% corruption:

You get a mask ending

Lose access to other masks

Reality warps to their personality

✔ Rumor Network

Students talk:

“I saw you sneaking out at night.”

“You stared at Mr. Tanaka like you were going to punch him.”

“Why were you crying yesterday?”

Rumors shape:

Groups that accept/reject you

How teachers treat you

Whether someone trusts your help

Masks can manipulate the rumor network.

✔ Fragmented Memory System

Certain nighttime events unlock lost memories.
Memories change who you think you are…
…sometimes contradicting each other.

🎇 5. Event Ideas
Morning Events

Teacher confrontation

“Did you study?” → mask influences your answer

Classmate asks for help

School Day Events

Surprise test

Bully interaction

Clubs recruiting you

Lockdown drill (Fear Mask very useful)

Someone confesses a secret

After School

Follow rumors to uncover drama

Help a classmate with their problem

Return a lost item (or steal it using Trickster Mask)

Meet your crush

Suspicious teacher acting strangely

Night Events

Mask duel: two masks try to take control

Fox spirit tests you

“Urban legend” encounter

Memory fragment of childhood

Spirit marketplace where masks can “trade favors”

🌟 Optional Twist

Your real face is not shown until late game, and masks are slowly replacing your personality. You might eventually choose to:

Break the masks

Let one consume you

Fuse all masks into a “True Self”

Return them to the shrine and face reality
